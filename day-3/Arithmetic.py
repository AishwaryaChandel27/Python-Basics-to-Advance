#Arithmetic Operators in Python
#Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.

#Example 1: Arithmetic operators in Python

a = 9
b = 4

Add = a + b   #Addition of numbers

Sub = a - b   #Subtraction of numbers

Mul = a * b   #Multiplication of number

Div = a / b   #Division(float) of number

Floor = a // b #Division(floor) of number . Floor division means division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line

Mod = a % b   #Modulus of both number . Modulus means remainder after division

Exp = a ** b  #Exponent of both numbers . Exponent means a raise to the power of b
