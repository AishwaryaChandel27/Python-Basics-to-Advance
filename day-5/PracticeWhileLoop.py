# Practice for while loop 

# Problem 1: Simple While Loop
# Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the concept of a while loop:
'''
i = int(input("Enter a number: "))
while i <= 20 :
  print(i)
  i = i+1 '''

#Exercise 2: Fibonacci Sequence
#fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

''' m , n= 0 , 1
while n and m <=100:
  print(n)
  m , n = n , m+n # this is the same as m = n and n = m+n
  '''

#Problem 3: WAP to print the following 10 even , odd , natural and whole numbers

''' n = 0
while n <= 9:
  print("even number :" , n*2)
  n = n+1

m = 0
while m  <= 10:
  print ("odd number : ", m*2+1)
  m= m+1
'''
